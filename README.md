This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objective 

Build a To Do list type web application or API that meets challenge requirements

### Requirements

- Front-End API or Back-End API. 
    - Must be able to demo it either on local or web-accessible URL.
- The user should be able to create multiple items that they want to remember to do and must be able to add, edit and remove tasks
- Each item must have:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Status (i.e. Pending, Done)
    - Due Date
- Make it simple for the user to track the status of multiple items as well as remember when things are due
- Must work on a desktop web browser

## Setup

- Fork and clone
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start app

## Explanation 

I've created a very simple and vanilla todo list app.
The input area checks all areas are filled in.
Clear button can clear ALL todos.
Can change todos to completed or pending.

Due to time constraints I couldn't implement other features such as filtering and sorting.

## Things remaining to do 

- Split functions away in a seperate file
- Split individual todo items away from 'TodoList.js'
- Clean up code
- Add a sort feature
